# Gulp KSS

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) integration with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/)

It utilizes [Gulp-KSS](https://github.com/philj/gulp-kss) and follows the [KSS-Node demo](https://github.com/hughsk/kss-node) but with sass instead of less

## Instructions

Clone the repo

cd to the directory

Install the node modules with `npm install`

Generate the styleguide with the default gulp command.

`gulp`

This will create a directory called 'styleguide'. Open up index.html and you're good to go.

You can also use live reload with `gulp watch`
